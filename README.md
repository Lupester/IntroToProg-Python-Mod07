Assignment 07

In the seventh segment of our class, we covered Python pickling and exception handling.  The lesson also includes the benefits of using structured error, and the differences between text and binary files.  The assignment notes also included a section of debugging and understanding the distinction between local variables vs. global variables. The latter being variables declared in a “body of a script and may be used any place in the scripts.

### Webpages

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Lupester/IntroToProg-Python-Mod07/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### Applying our Knowledge
After reviewing the required reading, lecture notes, videos, and web pages, we then were required to complete an assignment. By modifying my previous “HomeInventory.txt” and changing the file to “Toolbox.dat.” The final step was of the assignment was to upload our documents onto the GitHub website and create a weblink.
